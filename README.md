# Cockerham Surname Summary

*Updated: {{2025-11-04}}*

The surname **Cockerham** is of **Anglo-Saxon origin**, derived as a locational name from the village of Cockerham in Lancashire, England, near the River Cocker. The river's name traces back to ancient Celtic roots, from the pre-Roman British word *kukro* meaning "crooked" or "winding," combined with Old English *hām* (homestead) or *hamm* (enclosure by water). This evokes a "homestead by the winding river." The earliest recorded bearer was **John de Kokerham** in 1349, in the Register of Freemen of York during Edward III's reign—marking the surname's emergence amid England's Poll Tax era.

Historically, Cockerham families were tied to rural Lancashire life, with early migrations to colonial America (e.g., William Cockerham arriving in Virginia c. 1650, contributing to Southern land deeds). Variants include Cockram, Cockrem, Cockran, Cochran, and Cockren, often regional (e.g., Cockram around Bristol). The name spread via 19th-century immigration, with occupational ties like farming and trades in UK censuses.

Today, Cockerham ranks as the **71,148th most common surname globally** (stable since 2010s), held by ~7,000 people (1 in 1,049,625). It's predominantly in the **United States (90% of bearers)**, concentrated in the Southeast: North Carolina (18%), Texas (16%), Louisiana (14%), Mississippi, Florida, and Alabama. Smaller pockets exist in England (8%), Canada (1%), and 18 other countries. In the 2010 U.S. Census, it was ranked ~6,943rd (4,830 bearers), reflecting strong Anglo-North American roots.
